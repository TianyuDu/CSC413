    "# Programming Assignment 1: Learning Distributed Word Representations\n",
    "Based on an assignment by George Dahl\n",
    "\n",
    "For CSC413/2516 in Winter 2020 with Professor Jimmy Ba\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:**\n",
    "You must submit two files through MarkUs: a PDF file containing your writeup, titled *a1-writeup.pdf*, and your code file *language_model.ipynb*. Your writeup must be typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming assignments are individual work. See the Course Syllabus for detailed policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "In this assignment we will learn about word embeddings and make neural networks learn about words.\n",
    "We could try to match statistics about the words, or we could train a network that takes a sequence of words as input and learns to predict the word that comes next.\n",
    "        \n",
    "This assignment will ask you to implement a linear embedding and then the backpropagation computations for a neural language model and then run some experiments to analyze the learned representation.\n",
    "The amount of code you have to write is very short but each line will require you to think very carefully.\n",
    "You will need to derive the updates mathematically, and then implement them using matrix and vector operations in NumPy."
