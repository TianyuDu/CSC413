        "This assignment will focus on the applications of convolutional neural networks in various image processing tasks. First, we will train a convolutional neural network for a task known as image colourization. Given a greyscale image, we will predict the colour at each pixel. This a difficult problem for many reasons, one of which being that it is ill-posed: for a single greyscale image, there can be multiple,  equally valid colourings. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the second half of the assignment, we will perform fine-tuning on a pre-trained semantic segmentation model. Semantic segmentation attempts to clusters the areas of an image which belongs to the same object (label), and treats each pixel as a classification problem. We will fine-tune a pre-trained conv net featuring dilated convolution to segment flowers from the [Oxford17 flower dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/)"

Each layers have the similar number of parameters, so the total number of parameters for the model is proportional to *n*. Describe the difference in memory complexity in terms of *n* between fine-tuning an entire pre-trained model versus fine-tuning only the last layer (freezing all the other layers). What about the computational complexity? "
